# Image_resolution_enhancement

The purpose of this project is to develop a quick and efficient method to construct a high resolution image from a low resolution input image. I have employed a shallow convolutional neural network for this purpose and used the PIRM dataset containing low and high resolution images for training.
The primary advantage of this approach is that it uses a shallow network, thus allowing fast and easy computation utilising minimal storge space. This provides scope for utilising the model under limited storage and time constraints. Further development of the model could make it a strong candidate for usage in mobile and low cost applications.
